Developed an Integrated Video Meeting Application with Authentication, WebRTC, and Meeting History
In this project, I developed a fully functional video meeting application, incorporating a range of features to provide users with a seamless and secure experience. The app includes user authentication, real-time video communication, and a meeting history feature, all built using modern technologies like React and Material UI.

Key Features:

Authentication System:

Integrated SignIn and SignUp features using Material UI to create a sleek, user-friendly authentication page. Users can easily register and log in to their accounts.
Implemented Context API to manage the authentication state globally, ensuring users remain logged in across different components and routes. The authorization flow restricts access to protected routes for authenticated users only.
WebRTC Integration:

Enabled peer-to-peer video communication by integrating WebRTC, allowing users to join real-time video calls. The STUN server ensures smooth connectivity even behind firewalls and NAT.
Developed a Video Meet Component, providing a grid-based layout for video streams and customizable controls to toggle audio, video, and screen sharing. Real-time audio and video controls were implemented, allowing users to mute/unmute, enable/disable video, and switch devices.
Custom Meeting UI:

Designed and implemented a polished, responsive meeting UI using custom CSS. The interface is intuitive and adaptive, providing a clean and organized layout for video calls across all devices, with controls for managing the video streams, audio settings, and meeting interactions.
Meeting History Feature:

Created a meeting history feature to store and display past meetings, including participants, duration, and timestamps. Users can easily access and review their meeting history through a dedicated section, improving organization and tracking for ongoing projects or follow-ups.
By combining these features, I created a comprehensive video conferencing solution that provides users with a seamless authentication process, smooth real-time communication, a user-friendly interface, and easy access to past meetings. This application ensures a secure and scalable video conferencing experience, enhancing collaboration and productivity for all users.
